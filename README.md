# PRODIGY_CS_03
This repository features a Python script designed to evaluate the strength of a password (Password complexity checker) based on several key criteria, ensuring robust security. The script assesses the password's length and verifies the presence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. By analyzing these aspects, it provides detailed feedback on each criterion and assigns an overall strength rating, categorized as Very Strong, Strong, Medium, or Weak.

Features: 

Password length check: Evaluates if the password meets the minimum length requirement and provides feedback.

Character inclusion: Ensures the inclusion of both lowercase and uppercase letters.

Numerical verification: Checks for the presence of numerical digits.

Special Character Verification: Confirms the presence of special characters.

Comprehensive Feedback: Outputs the overall strength of the password and offers suggestions for improvement.

Usage:

-Run the script.

-Enter a password when prompted.

-Receive detailed feedback on the password's strength along with suggestions for enhancement.

This tool helps users create stronger, more secure passwords by offering insights and guidance on improving password complexity.
